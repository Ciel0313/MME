### Theory of the “No-Parallax” Point in Panorama Photography

#Version 1.0, February 6, 2006
Rik Littlefield

The purpose of this article is to eliminate the confusion. It explains in simple terms why
the no-parallax point is located at the entrance pupil, is also the center of perspective, and
can be moved by modifying just the aperture, while leaving all refracting lens elements
and the sensor in the same place. It also explains how the angle of view (Panorama Tools
hfov) is actually determined by the position of the no-parallax point, not just the lens and
sensor. And finally, it explains why physical vignetting can cause bad stitches in addition to dark bands. Along the way, it clarifies that the no-parallax point is far different from
the lens designer’s “nodal point,” despite widespread use of that term among panorama
photographers.
