using specialized equipment or software

captures images with elongated fields of view

known as wide format photography

there is no formal division between "wide-angle" and "panoramic" photography

"wide-angle" normally refers to a type of lens, but using this lens type does not necessarily make an image a panorama

An image showing a field of view approximating, or greater than, that of the human eye – about 160° by 75° – may be termed panoramic

It is believed that the panorama initially had eleven plates, but the original daguerreotypes no longer exist

- ### history

first:Joseph Puchberger in Austria in 1843 for a hand-cranked, 150° field of view, 8-inch focal length camera that exposed a relatively large Daguerreotype, up to 24 inches (610 mm) long

most successful:Friedrich von Martens in Germany in 1844

Following the invention of flexible film in 1888, panoramic photography was revolutionised

examples:Cylindrograph, Wonder Panoramic, Pantascopic and Cyclo-Pan
