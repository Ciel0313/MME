Among these new panoramists is Kenneth Snelson, an internationally known sculptor who lives in Soho, a New York art district. Since 1975, Snelson has experimented with various ways of making panoramas; his pictures have been included in major survey exhibitions and are shown regularly at the Zabriskie Gallery in New York and Paris.
